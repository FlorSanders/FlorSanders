Hi ðŸ‘‹! My name is Flor Sanders.

Ever since I was young, I've had a fascination with science and
technology. I found my passion in the fields of computer science and
electrical engineering, which I have pursued in my academic studies
at Ghent University and Columbia University. Today, I am committed
to leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create positive impact in
our world.

The easiest way to reach me is through my [website](https://www.florsanders.be/). ðŸ“«
